> [!WARNING]
> This project currently has many flaws. I will be glad to have any help.
> Known issues:
> 1. You have to import each callback function into the main file.
> 2. Passing arguments from server to client and back again is done in a questionable way.
> 3. Most likely the Browser class is implemented unsuccessfully.
